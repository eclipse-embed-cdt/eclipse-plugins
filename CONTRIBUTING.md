## Submit bug reports & enhancement requests

If you are convinced you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the GNU ARM Eclipse **plug-ins**, please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues) tracker.

Be sure you report only issues related to the GNU ARM Eclipse **plug-ins**. **DO NOT** use it for issues related to the tools (QEMU, OpenOCD, Build tools, etc), which should be addressed to their corresponding trackers. Web content issues should be addressed to the [Web Issues](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/gnuarmeclipse.github.io/issues/1) tracker. J-Link specific questions should be addresses to SEGGER support.

Before reporting issues, please check the list of [Known Issues](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/known-issues/) and the [FAQ](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/faq/).

When entering a new issue, be sure you provide:

* plug-in version (sorry, no requests for 0.5.x)
* Eclipse version
* Java version
* operating system (sorry, no requests for Win XP 64)
* toolchain version
* the **detailed and complete list of steps to reproduce the bug** (mandatory)

Please understand that without being able to reproduce the bug we cannot identify your problem.

To be allowed to enter issues, you need to first login to GitHug.

Note: the text should respect the markdown syntax; preview the message before posting and correct if it does not look as  expected, especially inline code or other quoted text.
