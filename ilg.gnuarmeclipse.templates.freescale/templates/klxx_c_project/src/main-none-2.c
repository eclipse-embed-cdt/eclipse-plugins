 * The build does not use startup files, and, in the simple template version,
 * does not even use any standard library function.
 *
 * If the application requires special initialisation code present
 * in some other libraries (for example librdimon.a, for semihosting),
 * define USE_STARTUP_FILES and uncheck the corresponding option in the
 * linker configuration.
