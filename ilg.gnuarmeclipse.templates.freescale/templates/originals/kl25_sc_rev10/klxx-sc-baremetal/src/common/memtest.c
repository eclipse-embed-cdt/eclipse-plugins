 * Description: Test the data bus wiring in a memory region by

 *              within that region.  The address (and hence the
 *              memory region) is selected by the caller.
 *
 * Notes:       
 *
 * Returns:     0 if the test succeeds.  
 *              A non-zero result is the first pattern that failed.

 *
 * Function:    memTestAddressBus()
 *
 * Description: Test the address bus wiring in a memory region by
 *              performing a walking 1's test on the relevant bits
 *              of the address and checking for aliasing. This test
 *              will find single-bit address failures such as stuck
 *              -high, stuck-low, and shorted pins.  The base address
 *              and size of the region are selected by the caller.
 *
 * Notes:       For best results, the selected base address should
 *              have enough LSB 0's to guarantee single address bit
 *              changes.  For example, to test a 64-Kbyte region, 
 *              select a base address on a 64-Kbyte boundary.  Also, 
 *              select the region size as a power-of-two--if at all 
 *              possible.
 *
 * Returns:     NULL if the test succeeds.  
 *              A non-zero result is the first address at which an
 *              aliasing problem was uncovered.  By examining the
 *              contents of memory, it may be possible to gather
 *              additional information about the problem.
